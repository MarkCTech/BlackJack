# BlackJack  
## Summary  
This plays a very simple version of the classic card game BlackJack. The aim of the game is to draw a hand of cards that totals higher than the Dealers hand, but no higher than 21!  
My version does not yet have the functionality for actions such as doubling down or splitting your hand, but this will come in future updates.

## Using the program
Run the .PY in your IDE, place your bet and have fun!
